# Climate

This is the original pure JavaScript and HTML version of the 4D Visual Delivery (4DVD) Climate Visualization tool.  A working version of this web application can be found here: http://climate.mrsharky.com

This version is considered outdated and I am actively working on porting this codebase over to Angular2. For the newer version please go to: https://github.com/dafrenchyman/climate2/. However, I do believe others may find this non-Angular version of the code useful so I'm posting it up anyway.

The database component is not included as part of this (and will be put in it's own repository when I've cleaned it up).

This software is being developed as part of my PhD dissertation work. It uses a lot of other open source libraries and files:
- http://c3js.org/: Timeseries charts
- https://d3js.org/: For the colorbar legend
- http://glmatrix.net/: For help with all the WebGL stuff
- http://jquery.com/: Makes this pure JavaScript project a little more managable
- http://jqueryui.com/: UI
- http://momentjs.com/: Time manipulation
- http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/: Used so the view information can be saved as part of the URL
- http://colorbrewer2.org/: Many different color schemes come from here
- http://www.naturalearthdata.com/: Shapefiles from there converted to .js files for this project
- ... I hopefully didn't leave anything out.... only open source libraries used
